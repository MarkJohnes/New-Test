The director of the job centre identified a few barriers to these jobs which included skills gaps, desire, motivation, criminal records and lack of experience. The aim of the two day session was to identify solutions to the problem of matching job opportunities with the unemployed.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-4 process">1. <strong>Empathise: </strong>I conducted some user research using social media, I received a range of useful feedback that echoed the challenges faced by the DWP.  All members of our team interviewed the job centre coaches and former job centre claimants.  This helped us identify the pain points experienced by both user groups.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">One of the most telling responses from the research.</div><img src="../images/5a2ecf4ea298f5000112e91c_fb-feedback.jpg" class="image-4">
    <div class="marks-container">
      <p class="paragraph-4 process">2. <strong>Identifying the needs: </strong>Claimants felt: Unqualified for work they are put forward for. Misunderstood by the job coachesLow in mood due to lack of success in the job hunt.</p><img src="../images/5a61df6ebafcac0001a31832_Screen_Shot_2018-01-19_at_12.06.09.jpg" srcset="../images/5a61df6ebafcac0001a31832_Screen_Shot_2018-01-19_at_12.06.09-p-800.jpeg 800w, ../images/5a61df6ebafcac0001a31832_Screen_Shot_2018-01-19_at_12.06.09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 95vw, 900px" class="image-5">
      <div class="paragraph-4 process w-richtext">
        <p><strong>Coaches felt:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>There was very little time available to get to know users due to admin work loads</li>
          <li>Users did not know what kind of work they wanted to do.</li>
          <li>It was a challenge to help users match their career goals with whats available in the market.</li>
          <li>Identifying transferable skills would help expand users opportunities<br></li>

        <h3>3. <strong>Ideation</strong></h3>
        <p>As a team we identified the friction between the candidate and job coach could be eased by a solution that would help reduce the coach&#x27;s admin work load so he would be freed up to get to know the candidate.  </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The idea would be for the claimant to enter all necessary admin tasks before the initial meeting using the app that we would design</li>
          <li>Integrate a personality test that would help the candidate identify her strengths &amp; available Job Opportunities based on the test results. This could also be an opportunity to suggest relevant stills training projects.</li>
          <li>Integrate an element of emotional support to keep the candidate motivated, this could also include, an immediate therapist approved set of articles too motivate claimants on their job hunt.<br></li>
        </ul>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h4><strong>4. Prototype </strong></h4>
        <p>I designed a clickable prototype using Marvel App based on our sketches and ideas generated from the interviews and user research.<a href="https://www.freshcourage.co/rekindle-app"></a><br></p>
      </div><img src="../images/5a61dd82775c0f00014960c7_Untitled_design_1.jpg" srcset="../images/5a61dd82775c0f00014960c7_Untitled_design_1-p-800.jpeg 800w, ../images/5a61dd82775c0f00014960c7_Untitled_design_1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 95vw, 900px">
      <div class="paragraph-4 process w-richtext">
        <h4><strong>5. Validate</strong></h4>
        <p>We tested the prototype with a former job centre user and he felt that sharing such personal information with the coach would seem intrusive so we decided to make the emotional health aspect of the app private only to the candidate. I designed a simpler less intrusive question that would be fed back to the coach so he would be sensitive to the users needs without being too intrusive. We tested this idea with the same user and he felt this would be more acceptable and would help the coach be more sensitive to the candidates state of mind before the interview.</p>

              <li>Give the user mental health support so the user stays motivated throughout the process with therapist approved resources.</li>
