          <p class="paragraph-4">A recent increase in delivery charges from eternal delivery partners had begun to reduce the restaurants profit margin. In response to the price increase Palmera Oasis decided to build an in-house solution in an effort to regain independence. <br><br>However the solution was badly designed and just as expensive resulting in difficulty attracting existing customers away from using external delivery partners. They had unsuccessfully tried offering vouchers and other incentives with little success.  <br><br>Customers had stated that they did not trust that the restaurants website was secure and the experience of ordering online was met with great difficulty.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-4 process"><strong>Research: </strong>Initially I attempted to order through the external partner apps to get a feel for the current experience for the customer. I also spoke with the restaurant staff to get an understanding of their current process of receiving orders and any feedback they received from customers. <br><br>‍<strong>Key findings: </strong>Customers felt that their card details were safer on the external partner appsStaff struggled to balance taking phone orders over the phone while dealing with in-store customersThe current website branding did not match the in-store branding reducing the trust associationIt was difficult to get to navigate to the order section from the menu</p>

      <p class="paragraph-4 process"><strong>Planning:</strong> My plan was to build a website that matched the in-store branding and use a software solution with an improved process of ordering that is intuitive. Customers are familiar with paying by card in person so I used this logic to by-pass the website and introduce a card reader for the drive</p><img src="../images/5a2836da27202d0001a2d5f4_Screen_Shot_2017-12-06_at_18.28.25.jpg" srcset="../images/5a2836da27202d0001a2d5f4_Screen_Shot_2017-12-06_at_18.28.25-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/5a2836da27202d0001a2d5f4_Screen_Shot_2017-12-06_at_18.28.25.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 95vw, 900px" class="image-5">

        <p>We installed a free open source software solution that works with a brand new website we created to simplify the ordering process.</p>

          <li>I used the blue colour associated with restaurants in-store branding</li>
          <li>A simple combined menu and ordering button the speeds up and simplifies the ordering process.</li>
          <li>I decided to remove the option of paying online which was proving a barrier to entry</li>
          <li>I dedicated a section to explain the ordering process so customers had the full picture at a glance</li>
          <li>The explanation was designed to reassure the customer that the website is safe to use</li>
